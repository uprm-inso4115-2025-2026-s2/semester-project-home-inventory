|===
|Strategy |Description |Pros |Cons

|Fixed Quantity Threshold
|The system triggers a low-stock alert when the item quantity falls below a predefined fixed value.
|Very simple to implement. Easy to understand. Requires no historical data.
|Not adaptive to demand changes. Same threshold may not fit all items.

|Percentage-Based Threshold
|The system triggers an alert when the stock falls below a certain percentage of the item’s maximum quantity.
|More flexible than fixed thresholds. Scales better across different item quantities.
|Requires knowing the maximum stock level. Still not demand-aware.

|Reorder Point Model
|The system calculates a reorder point based on average demand and lead time, triggering alerts when stock reaches that level.
|More accurate for high-volume inventory. Reduces risk of stockouts.
|Requires historical sales data and lead time tracking. More complex to implement.

|Safety Stock Approach
|The system maintains an extra buffer of stock to account for demand variability and delays.
|Improves reliability. Handles uncertainty well.
|Complex calculations. Overkill for small or simple systems.

== Best Practices for Low Stock Detection

* Choose a strategy that aligns with the system’s complexity and available data.
* Avoid overly complex models.
* Prevent repeated alerts by triggering notifications only when crossing the low-stock threshold.
* Allow thresholds to be configurable to support different item behaviors.


== Recommendation

Based on the research, the recommended approach is a fixed quantity threshold with per-item configuration. This strategy offers a balance between simplicity and flexibility while remaining easy to implement within the project’s scope.
