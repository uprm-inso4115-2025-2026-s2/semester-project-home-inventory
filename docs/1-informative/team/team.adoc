== 1.1 Team

[abstract]

For Milestone 1, the team was organized into four functional groups. These are Research,
Functionality, Design, and Documentation; plus three Managers. In this context, all team members
are considered partners. No external partners have been identified for this milestone; if any arise,
their roles and responsibilities will be documented. The lists are presented in alphabetical order
and indicate each group’s Team Leader. The Tasks column is reserved for recording completed
issues. 

=== Partner justification
TODO: 2–4 sentences explaining why all members are partners (or note any external partners and their role).
