== 1.2.3 Ideas

[abstract]
Outline candidate solution directions. Ideas are not commitments; they are options to address the needs.

== Idea A — Lightweight Smart Inventory

* Core concept: A mobile home inventory application optimized for ultra fast item capture and shared household visibility, built with Flutter and a service like Firebase for real time synchronization.
* Needs addressed: N1, N2, N3, N4, N5
* Key capabilities:
  - Rapid item entry with minimal required fields
  - Real time shared inventory across household members
  - Quick search and filtering to check item availability
  - Optional reminder system
  - Offline support with background sync

* Expected benefits:
  - Reduces the hassle of item entry
  - Improves long-term inventory accuracy
  - Prevents duplicate purchases
  - Enables smooth roommate coordination
  - Maintains low notification fatigue

* Risks / unknowns:
  - Users may still abandon after initial novelty wears off
  - Real-time sync conflicts in households with more than one user
  - Offline synchronization edge cases
  - User adoption of shared features may vary

* How we will validate this idea:
  - Conduct usability tests measuring item entry by time
  - Track weekly retention during pilot testing
  - Test with small shared households (2-4 users)
  - Monitor notification opt-out rates
