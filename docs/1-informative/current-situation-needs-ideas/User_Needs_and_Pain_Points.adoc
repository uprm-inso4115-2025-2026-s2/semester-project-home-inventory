:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Executive Summary

This research analyzes existing home inventory and pantry management solutions, in addition to user feedback, to identify the most common frustrations and needs of students living independently. These findings have shown a demand for item tracking without much hassle, and having a reliable reminder once in a while about inventory. These gaps in current solutions give our application clear opportunities for differentiation and improvements.

---

== Methodology
The following sources were reviewed:

* Competing applications (Sortly, Pantry Check, KitchenPal)
* App Store and Google Play user reviews
* Reddit discussions (college living, roommates, frugal living)
* Product comparison blogs and UX best practice articles

The goal was to identify repeated pain patterns rather than normal complaints.

== Top Validated User Pain Points

=== 1. High Friction When Adding Items
Users repeatedly report that manual inventory entry is tedious and time consuming.

**Evidence themes:**

- Apps often require too many fields  
- Manual entry discourages long term use  
- Users strongly value barcode scanning to speed inventory  

Inventory tools emphasize barcode scanning because it makes it easy to track inventory without much hassle, showing how important low friction data entry is for users. 

**Impact:**
Users abandon tracking after initial setup.

**Implication for our app:**
Prioritize ultra-fast add flow and smart defaults.

---

=== 2. Users Struggle to Maintain Their Inventory
Even motivated users fail to keep inventories updated over time.

**Evidence themes:**

- Maintenance burden is too much
- Students want automation and reminders  
- Many apps are designed for businesses, not busy individuals, nor college students

Most inventory tools focus on business workflows and large inventories rather than personal use, which is not what college students are looking forward to. 

**Impact:**
Inventory accuracy quickly degrades.

**Implication:**
Design for low maintenance usage and quick edits.

---

=== 3. Notification and Alert Systems Are Critical
Users consistently value low stock and date based alerts.

Many inventory apps highlight features like “low stock alerts” and “date-based alerts,” showing strong user demand for automated reminders.

**Observed problem:**
Current implementations are often too noisy or poorly configured.

**Impact:**
Users still run out of items or waste food.

**Implication:**
Provide configurable, intelligent notification thresholds.

---

=== 4. Pricing and Value Friction
Cost sensitivity is a recurring complaint.

**Impact:**
Students and casual users avoid or abandon paid solutions.

**Implication:**
Freemium model and strong free tier are important for adoption.

---

=== 5. Poor UX and Feature Gaps in Pantry Apps
Community discussions highlight missing functionality and weak UX.

**Impact:**
Users must combine multiple apps or abandon the workflow.

**Implication:**
Unified experience is a major opportunity in this industry.

== Key Gaps in Existing Solutions 
=== Opportunity 1: Student Focused UX
Most inventory apps target insurance, business, or homeowners.

**Differentiation:**

- Mobile first workflows  
- minimal required input  
- fast student friendly flows  

---

=== Opportunity 2: Reliable Shared Inventory
Multi user inventory exists but is rarely optimized for roommates.

**Differentiation:**

- real-time sync  
- duplicate purchase warnings  
- simple sharing flow  

---

=== Opportunity 3: Low Maintenance Experience
Users abandon apps that require constant manual upkeep.

**Differentiation:**

- smart reminders  
- bulk updates  
- intelligent defaults  
- passive tracking where possible  

---

== Recommendations for Implementation

* Prioritize fast item creation flow (less than 3 taps preferrably)
* Implement flexible notification thresholds
* Design shared inventory using real time backend (e.g., Firebase)
* Provide strong filtering by:
** room  
** category  
** priority  
* Optimize for mobile first student usage patterns
