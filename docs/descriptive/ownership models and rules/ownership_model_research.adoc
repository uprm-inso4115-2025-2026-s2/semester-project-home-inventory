== Objective
This document analyzes conceptual ownership models applicable to shared-resource environments. The goal is to understand how ownership relationships may be structured in order to support sharing, permissions, and accountability within a collaborative inventory domain.

== Definition of Ownership Model
An ownership model is defined as:

- the actor that holds primary responsibility for a resource
- the context in which ownership exists
- the authority and accountability implied by ownership

In collaborative inventory systems, ownership determines how items relate to users and shared inventories.

== Ownership Model 1: User-Owned Resources
A resource is associated with a specific individual who holds primary responsibility and control independent of group context.

Relationship structure: Resource ↔ User

=== Characteristics
- Ownership is individual.
- Responsibility is clearly attributable.
- Sharing is an additional capability rather than inherent.

=== Advantages
- Clear accountability
- Simple responsibility tracking
- Intuitive model for personal assets

=== Limitations
- Weak support for inherently shared resources
- Requires additional mechanisms for collaboration
- Ownership may conflict with collective use cases

=== Implications for Shared Inventory Systems
This model is suitable when items represent individual contributions within a shared environment.

== Ownership Model 2: Group-Owned Resources
A resource belongs to a collective entity such as an inventory or household. Users interact with the resource through membership rather than ownership.

Relationship structure: Resource ↔ Group

=== Characteristics
- Ownership is collective.
- Permissions derive from group roles.
- Resources exist only within a shared context.

=== Advantages
- Natural support for collaboration
- Consistent with communal resource management
- Simplified sharing semantics

=== Limitations
- No inherent individual accountability
- Responsibility attribution requires additional mechanisms
- Ownership transfer is not meaningful

=== Implications for Shared Inventory Systems
This model is appropriate for communal resources that are jointly maintained and used.

== Ownership Model 3: Hybrid Ownership
A resource exists within a shared group context but is associated with a responsible member or subset of members.

Relationship structure: Resource ↔ Group and/or Resource ↔ Responsible Member (within group context)

=== Characteristics
- Combines shared context with individual responsibility
- Permissions may derive from both roles and ownership
- Supports accountability within collaboration

=== Advantages
- Supports both sharing and responsibility
- Flexible permission modeling
- Reflects real-world collaborative environments

=== Limitations
- Increased conceptual complexity
- Requires explicit ownership lifecycle definition
- More relationships must be modeled

=== Implications for Shared Inventory Systems
This model supports systems that require both collaborative access and responsibility attribution.

== Relevance to Ownership Schema Design
The ownership model selected for a collaborative inventory system determines:

- how items relate to users and groups
- where ownership relationships exist conceptually
- how permissions and responsibility may be enforced

This analysis provides a conceptual foundation for defining item ownership rules and the inventory membership structure.
