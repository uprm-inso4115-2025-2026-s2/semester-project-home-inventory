= Inventory Sharing Flowchart
:toc:

== Overview

This document explains the sharing workflow used in the Home Inventory.  
The sharing feature allows users to invite roommates or household members to access and collaborate on a shared inventory.

The flowchart provides a visual representation of how invitations are sent, processed, and how access to shared inventories is granted and managed.

== Sharing Workflow Summary

The sharing process follows these main steps:

1. The inventory owner selects an inventory to share.
2. The owner sends an invitation to a roommate.
3. The system marks the invitation as *Pending*.
4. The roommate receives the invitation.
5. The roommate can accept or reject the invitation.
6. If accepted, access to the shared inventory is granted.
7. If rejected, the invitation is closed.
8. The owner can manage or revoke access at any time.

== Flow States

The sharing process includes the following states:

* *Pending* — invitation has been sent but not yet accepted.
* *Accepted* — roommate accepted the invitation and has access.
* *Rejected* — roommate declined the invitation.
* *Revoked* — owner removed access after acceptance.

== Decision Points

The flow includes key decision points:

* Roommate chooses to accept or reject the invitation.
* System verifies permissions before granting access.
* Owner may remove access at any time.

== Access & Permissions

Once access is granted:

* The shared inventory appears in the roommate’s **Shared Inventories** list.
* The roommate’s actions depend on their assigned role:
  - Viewer → can view items.
  - Editor → can add or modify items.
  - Owner (optional) → full control.

== Owner Management Actions

Inventory owners can:

* View who has access
* Change user roles (if supported)
* Revoke access
* Resend invitations

== Purpose of the Flowchart

This flowchart helps:

* Designers understand the user experience
* Developers implement correct logic and states
* Team members maintain consistent sharing behavior
* Identify edge cases and permission handling
