== Domain Attributes Classification for Core Inventory

This section applies the lecture topic Domain Attributes to the Core Inventory subsystem by classifying key domain entities and behaviors according to their attributes (Static, Dynamic, Dynamic Inert, Dynamic Active, Discrete).

=== 1. Product

Represents an item definition (e.g., "Clorox Bleach 64oz Original").

Classification:
*Static
*Discrete

A product's definition does not change over time once created. Its properties (name, barcode, brand, size) remain constant and if we use the example in the beginning a "Clorox Bleach 64oz Original" will remain the same regardless of the passage of time, thus it is classified as Static. It is also Discrete because each product is its own distinct entity in the system.

=== 2. Item Stock Entry

Represents a specific purchase of a product, it includes information such as date of purchase, location of storage and date of expiration if applicable.

Classification:
*Dynamic Inert
*Discrete

An item changes only due to external actions such as user updates of the product, consumption, or location change. Since it is changed via external stimuli from the user it is considered Dynamic Inert. Each item has a separate record in the system, making it Discrete.

=== 3. Home

Represents a household container that groups rooms and inventory items.

Classification:
*Static
*Discrete

A home is a structural entity within the system and does not change state over time since it serves as a container for other entities. Each home is unique making it Discrete.

=== 4. Room

Represents a physical location within a home (e.g.,bedroom, pantry, fridge).

Classification:
*Static
*Discrete

Rooms are structural subdivisions of a home and do not change autonomously meaning that they are Static entities. Each room is uniquely represented, so it is Discrete.

=== 5. Owner

Represents the person associated with a specific item.

Classification:
*Static
*Discrete

An owner’s identity does not change over time, while item associations may change, the owner entity itself remains stable so it is Static. Each owner is their own distinct entity, making it Discrete.

=== 6. Duplicate Detection Logic

System logic that determines whether a new entry is a duplicate at either the product or the stock level.

Classification:
*Dynamic Active

Duplicate detection executes a rule-based behavior when users add or scan items. It responds to system events and applies programmed rule conditions. Therefore, the Duplicate Detection Logic is classified as Dynamic Active since it can change via internally programmed rules and various conditions.
