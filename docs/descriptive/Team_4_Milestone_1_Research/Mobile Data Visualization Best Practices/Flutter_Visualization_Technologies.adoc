= Flutter Technologies for Visualization Research

FL Chart: A highly customizable Flutter chart library that supports Line Chart, Bar Chart, Pie 
Chart, Scatter Chart, and Radar Chart.

* Distributed under the MIT license, meaning its free and suitable for academic or
commercial projects without licensing concerns.
* Allows for a good amount of control over chart appearance, animations, and other 
interactions.
* While generally efficient for typical dashboard use cases, performance issues and 
rendering bugs may appear when handling large datasets.

Syncfusion Flutter Charts: A Flutter Charts library which includes data visualization widgets 
such as cartesian and circular charts, to create real-time, interactive, high-performance, animated 
charts.

* A commercial license is required, though a free community license is available under 
specific conditions.
* Optimized for large datasets and complicated interactions, making it suitable for data 
heavy applications.
* Includes advanced functionality such as zooming, panning, tooltips, and legends with 
minimal custom code.

Graphic: A library based on the “grammar of graphics” system, offering immense flexibility in 
composing unique visualizations.

* Enables the creation of highly customized and unique visualizations beyond traditional 
chart types.
* Allows full control over user interactions and animated transitions.
* The grammar-based approach provides better capabilities but requires more familiarity 
with data visualization concepts compared to widget-based libraries.
