= UI Style Guide- Color Palette

The color palette is created with the goal of making the application consistent and pleasing to the user's eye. This color palette ensures that all components have appropriate contrast and look harmonious. Figma was used to determine the color palette, and four different ideas were developed, as follows:

* Idea #1

=== Color Naming and Usage Rules 
The selected color palette is the idea #4. The color palette will work in the next way:

* **Surface/Secondary Text - #FFFFFF** - This color is used for the surface (referring to cards, sections, and all creations of that style) and for secondary text to ensure that there is no poor contrast when used with dark colors.

* **Accent - #A3B18A** - Accent is a supporting color used to highlight key elements of the interface and direct the user's attention. It is applied to primary actions (such as buttons), important states (badges/alerts), and active selections (tabs or filters). When used sparingly, it keeps the application clean and improves visual clarity and navigation.
