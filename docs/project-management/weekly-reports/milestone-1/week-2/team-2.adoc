# Milestone 1 Week 2 — Team 2 Progress Report

---

## Objective
Ensure that during Scrum Prep, the project has a clear and organized summary of what Team 2 worked on this week.

---

## What the Team Accomplished This Week
- The team began initial domain acquisition and feature research.
- We carefully reviewed the Team 2 – Milestone 1 – Task Schema guide and role distribution document.
- Based on the provided structure by a role distribution document, each member selected their primary focus area for this sprint.
-For Milestone 1, Team 2 divided the feature into structured research roles to ensure clarity.Each researcher selected a main category and will break it down into smaller, well-defined GitHub tasks 

    The selected focus areas include:

    - Expiration Logic (R1)
    - Low Stock Logic (R2)
    - Automated Check System (R3)

    - Notifications / Alerts System (R4)
    - Grocery List & Restock Autogeneration (R5)
    - Alerts UI & UX (D1)
    - Grocery List UI (D2)
- Responsibilities were clearly defined according to the milestone requirement, which focuses strictly on:
  * Research
  * Documentation on how the feature should work
  * Database schema design (Supabase)
  * User flow and system diagrams
- No implementation work has started, as this milestone is research and design oriented.

---

## Blockers or Challenges
- The project documentation base structure is still not fully available.

---

## Plans for Next Week
- Finalize and document all research findings.
- Define clear logic rules for selected feature categories.
- Design database schema structures in Supabase.
- Create user flow and system diagrams.

---

## Tasks Completed / Issues Closed

## What Is Currently In Progress
- Research for domain acquisition and structured documentation.
- Defining feature ownership and breaking main focus areas into milestone subtasks.
- Designing feature flows according to initial platform assumptions.
