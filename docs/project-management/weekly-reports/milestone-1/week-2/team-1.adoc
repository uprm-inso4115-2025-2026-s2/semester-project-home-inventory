- Designing the feature's pages according to our initial assumption of what the platform will have

---

## Blockers or Challenges
- Project documentation base structure is still not available to facilitate colaboration so any work done is still fragmented

---

## Plans for Next Week
- Complete initial research
- Design initial wireframes for the features pages
- Begin base implementation of the project, because our feature is the core of the app
- Start preparing a demo for the milestone video

---

## Documentation Links
