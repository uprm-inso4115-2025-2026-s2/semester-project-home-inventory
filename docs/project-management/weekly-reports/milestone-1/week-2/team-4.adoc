## Tasks Closed
- None yet. Research tasks are actively being worked on and are on track for completion before the sprint ends. Additional tasks from this team will begin shortly.

---

## Blockers or Challenges
- Project documentation base structure is still not available to facilitate colaboration so any work done is still fragmented, but as the project goes on the issue would be fixed.

---

## Plans for Next Week
- Complete initial research
- UI/UX design tasks for Dashboard and Reporting System can begin immediately as they are based on research and will produce the necessary assets for development.
- Starting to implement the static UI for the Home and Reports screens, which can start concurrently with the design phase, using mock data.
- Creating the foundational database views and functions, which is a critical dependency and should start early.
- Researching and setting up the charting library, which can begin right away to prepare for future integration.

## Documentation Links
- Pending. Documentation will be linked once the corresponding issues are reviewed and accepted.
