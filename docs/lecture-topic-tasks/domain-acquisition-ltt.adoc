= Domain Acquisition: Literature Review & Elicitation Studies


====
**AI Disclosure:** Portions of this literature review and domain research were synthesized with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence tools. The core concepts, validation of sources, and final domain model decisions were verified by the human author, @jankii03.

== Trade & Professional Associations
Use this list to identify standards for categorization and asset valuation, since automatic identification is not available.

* **NAPO (National Association of Productivity & Organizing Professionals)**
** *Relevance:* Since users must manually organize items, the app should follow NAPO's standard "Categorization Principles". This supports the project goal of organizing items "by room or priority" to reduce search time.

* **I.I.I. (Insurance Information Institute)**
** *Relevance:* For non-consumable home inventory, this body sets the standards for "Proof of Ownership." The app's manual entry fields should match their requirements to add value, supporting the goal to "Track spending of items".

* **NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) - Household Finance**
** *Relevance:* Validates the goal of "Tracking spending" and "Managing the budget". Research here supports the idea that manual inventory tracking acts as a "commitment device" for sticking to a budget, which is essential for the target demographic of students.

== Domain Literature Review 
Summaries of key texts to justify system logic, specifically addressing the challenges of manual data entry.

=== "Personal Information Management (PIM)" 
* **Core Finding:** The "Fragmentation Problem." Users struggle when their items are physical but the tracking is digital. The mental effort to manually bridge this gap is high.
* **Application to Project:** Since "juggling classes, work, and personal problems does not leave a lot of time", the UI must use "Smart Defaults" and "Autocomplete" to reduce cognitive load. If a user types "Mil...", the system should suggest "Milk - Expiring in 7 days" based on common data, rather than forcing them to type everything.

=== "Household Food Waste Patterns" 
* **Core Finding:** Students fail to track inventory because they lack "situational visibility." They don't know what they have until they open the cupboard.
* **Application to Project:** Supports the "Problem Background" regarding students relying on memory, which leads to purchasing duplicates. The app must serve as the "external memory."

=== "The Endowment Effect in Asset Management" 
* **Core Finding:** Owners overvalue items they manually track.
* **Application to Project:** By forcing students to manually enter items, they may become more conscious of waste and spending. This supports the "Countermeasure" of avoiding unnecessary spending.

== Research Note Cards
Discrete facts formatted for your Domain Model.

.RN-001: Manual Entry Friction & Abandonment
****
* **Category:** Stakeholder Behavior
* **Fact:** In manual data entry systems, every additional field reduces user retention.
* **Implication for App:** You cannot force the user to fill out every field for a simple item. The system must support "Minimum Viable Entry" to ensure students actually use it.
****

.RN-002: Subjective Categorization
****
* **Category:** Intrinsic
* **Fact:** Without standardized barcodes, categorization becomes subjective. One user puts "Batteries" in "Electronics," another in "Utility Drawer."
* **Implication for App:** The "Category" and "Location" filters mentioned in the countermeasures must be user-editable or allow for multi-tagging.
****

.RN-003: Expiration Heuristics
****
* **Category:** Support Technology
* **Fact:** Users rarely manually calculate expiration dates during data entry.
* **Implication for App:** To support the "Automated notifications and reminders" requirement, the system needs a lookup table of "Average Shelf Life." When a user types "Milk," the app should auto-suggest "Expires: +7 Days," allowing the user to simply confirm or tweak it.
****

.RN-004: Stockout vs. Capital Constraint
****
* **Category:** Intrinsic
* **Fact:** Students face a "working capital constraint".
* **Implication for App:** The "Track Spending" feature is critical. The app should visualize the "Total Value" of the inventory to show the user how much cash is "sitting on the shelf," helping them "manage the budget".
****

== Identified Inconsistencies & Abstractions

=== Abstraction
* **Observation:** In a manual system, tracking specific quantities is tedious.
* **Why:** Users will not open the app to update that they drank a glass of juice.
* **Recommendation:** Use broad "States" instead of strict integers for consumables.
** *Bad:* Quantity: 0.5 Gallons.
** *Good:* Status: Full -> Open -> Low -> Empty.

=== Inconsistency
* **Observation:** The A3 requests "Automated notifications... when a specific item is low".
* **Reality Check:** Without sensors or scanners, the system cannot know an item is low unless the user manually opens the app and tells it.
* **Refined Requirement:** The notification logic should likely be Time-Based. For example, "You bought bread 5 days ago, check if it's low", rather than Quantity-Based, as the app has no real-time visibility into the physical usage.
