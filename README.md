## 🎯 Project Overview

**Topic:** Digital Home Inventory  
**Target Audience:** Students living independently (alone or with roommates)  
**Date Started:** February 3, 2026

### The Problem
Students living on their own struggle to keep track of household items, resulting in:
- **Wasted money** - Buying duplicates or unnecessary items
- **Expired items** - Food and medicine expiring unnoticed
- **Poor budgeting** - Difficulty staying within budget due to overstocking
- **Communication issues** - With roommates, leading to duplicate purchases

### Root Causes
- Students rely on memory alone
- No centralized system to track household spending
- Busy schedules (classes, work, personal life) leave little time for inventory management

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

For students living alone, it is very important to keep track of household essentials, but with the stressful lifestyle some students experience, it can be difficult to do so. The lack of keeping track of household items can lead to unwanted problems such as:
- Suddenly running out of essential items
- Food and medicine expiring without notice
- Purchasing duplicates
- Poor coordination with roommates

Most students are on a budget, and without a system to keep track of their items, it is harder to stay within budget due to overstocking.

## 🚀 Project Goals

### Target
Design a user-friendly digital system that helps students living independently to efficiently track, manage, and organize their household items.

### Key Features (Countermeasures)
1. **Digital Inventory Management**
   - Maintain centralized inventory organized by room or priority
   - Categorize items (bathroom supplies, cleaning supplies, pantry items, etc.)

2. **Smart Notifications**
   - Automated reminders for low-stock items
   - Expiration date alerts
   - Customizable notification thresholds

3. **Efficient Organization**
   - Filter by category, location, or priority
   - Quick search functionality
   - Reduce time looking for items

4. **Budget Tracking**
   - Track spending on household items
   - Generate spending reports
   - Help manage budgets and avoid unnecessary purchases

5. **Roommate Coordination**
   - Shared inventory view
   - Prevent duplicate purchases
   - Clear ownership indicators

6. **Analytics & Reports**
   - Inventory reports
   - Expenditure analysis
   - Usage rate tracking
   - Shopping trip planning assistance

### Success Criteria (Check/Evaluate)
- ✅ Items display correctly in designated categories/rooms
- ✅ Updates and deletions are accurately reflected
- ✅ Notifications trigger at correct thresholds
- ✅ Filters return accurate results quickly
- ✅ Spending calculations match actual expenses
- ✅ Shared inventory syncs correctly between users
- ✅ Reports accurately reflect inventory data

### Continuous Improvement (Act/Standardize)
- Provide user tutorials for efficient app usage
- Set default reminders for expiring/low-stock items
- Use standardized categories and report templates
- Collect user feedback for continuous improvements
- Consider integration with other productivity/budgeting tools

## 👥 Team Structure

### Agile Feature-Based Organization
The project follows **Agile development principles** with feature-based teams. Each team works independently on a specific feature, allowing parallel development without dependencies.

#### Team Formation
Teams are organized around key features identified during sprint planning. Each feature team is responsible for:
- **Full feature ownership** - From research to implementation
- **Independent development** - Work in parallel without blocking other teams
- **End-to-end delivery** - Research, design, implementation, testing, and documentation

#### Current Teams

**📚 Documentation Team**
- Set up AsciiDoc documentation environment and structure
- Follow project documentation rubric
- Integrate contributions from all feature teams
- Manage documentation automation workflow
- Ensure all teams have access to updated documentation
- Maintain `/docs` folder structure

**🎨 Design Team**
- Work across all features to create UI/UX designs
- Create wireframes and user flows
- Design consistent visual language
- Provide design assets to feature teams

**Feature Teams** (TBD):
- Feature teams will be announced once features are finalized during brainstorming
- Each team will have 4-5 developers + 1 team lead
- Teams will research and implement their assigned feature
- *(Specific features and implementation approaches still being determined)*

#### Team Responsibilities
Each feature team will:
1. **Research** - Investigate libraries, tools, and implementation approaches for their feature
2. **Design Collaboration** - Work with Design Team on feature-specific UI/UX
3. **Implementation** - Build the feature end-to-end
4. **Documentation** - Provide documentation content to Documentation Team
5. **Testing** - Ensure feature works correctly
6. **Integration** - Handle merge conflicts and integrate with team branch

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*To be determined once tech stack is finalized*

### Installation
*Instructions will be added once development begins*

### Development Setup
*Setup guide will be added once tech stack is decided*

## 📚 Documentation

### Project Documentation
All project documentation is written in **AsciiDoc** format and stored in the `/docs` folder.

**Documentation Structure:**
- **Informative**: Current situation and needs analysis
- **Descriptive**: Domain sketch and system overview
- **Analytic**: Concept analysis and technical details

### Key Documents
- **[STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md)** - Coding standards and best practices
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Complete workflow guide
- **[LICENSE](LICENSE)** - Project license

### Branch Structure
```
main (protected)
├── documentation/
├── design/
├── feature-team-1/
├── feature-team-2/
└── feature-team-3/
```

**How it works:**
- Each team has one shared branch
- All developers work directly on their team's branch
- Developers commit and create PRs for team lead review
- Team leads merge commits to team branch
- Team leads PR team branch → main for manager approval

**Workflow:** Developer commit → Team branch → Team Lead review → Team branch merge → Team Lead PR to Main → Manager approval → Main
