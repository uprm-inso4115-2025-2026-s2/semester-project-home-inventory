## 🎯 Project Overview

**Topic:** Digital Home Inventory  
**Target Audience:** Students living independently (alone or with roommates)  
**Date Started:** February 3, 2026

### The Problem
Students living on their own struggle to keep track of household items, resulting in:
- **Wasted money** - Buying duplicates or unnecessary items
- **Expired items** - Food and medicine expiring unnoticed
- **Poor budgeting** - Difficulty staying within budget due to overstocking
- **Communication issues** - With roommates, leading to duplicate purchases

### Root Causes
- Students rely on memory alone
- No centralized system to track household spending
- Busy schedules (classes, work, personal life) leave little time for inventory management

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

For students living alone, it is very important to keep track of household essentials, but with the stressful lifestyle some students experience, it can be difficult to do so. The lack of keeping track of household items can lead to unwanted problems such as:
- Suddenly running out of essential items
- Food and medicine expiring without notice
- Purchasing duplicates
- Poor coordination with roommates

Most students are on a budget, and without a system to keep track of their items, it is harder to stay within budget due to overstocking.

## 🚀 Project Goals

### Target
Design a user-friendly digital system that helps students living independently to efficiently track, manage, and organize their household items.

### Key Features (Countermeasures)
1. **Digital Inventory Management**
   - Maintain centralized inventory organized by room or priority
   - Categorize items (bathroom supplies, cleaning supplies, pantry items, etc.)

2. **Smart Notifications**
   - Automated reminders for low-stock items
   - Expiration date alerts
   - Customizable notification thresholds

3. **Efficient Organization**
   - Filter by category, location, or priority
   - Quick search functionality
   - Reduce time looking for items

4. **Budget Tracking**
   - Track spending on household items
   - Generate spending reports
   - Help manage budgets and avoid unnecessary purchases

5. **Roommate Coordination**
   - Shared inventory view
   - Prevent duplicate purchases
   - Clear ownership indicators

6. **Analytics & Reports**
   - Inventory reports
   - Expenditure analysis
   - Usage rate tracking
   - Shopping trip planning assistance

### Success Criteria (Check/Evaluate)
- ✅ Items display correctly in designated categories/rooms
- ✅ Updates and deletions are accurately reflected
- ✅ Notifications trigger at correct thresholds
- ✅ Filters return accurate results quickly
- ✅ Spending calculations match actual expenses
- ✅ Shared inventory syncs correctly between users
- ✅ Reports accurately reflect inventory data

### Continuous Improvement (Act/Standardize)
- Provide user tutorials for efficient app usage
- Set default reminders for expiring/low-stock items
- Use standardized categories and report templates
- Collect user feedback for continuous improvements
- Consider integration with other productivity/budgeting tools

## 👥 Team Structure

### Organization
The project is divided into four specialized teams for the first milestone, each with around 5 developers and a team lead.

#### 📚 Team: Documentation
**Responsibilities:**
- Set up AsciiDoc structure in `/docs` folder
- Implement informative parts (current situation, needs, ideas)
- Create descriptive parts (domain description, rough sketch/narrative/terminology)
- Develop analytic parts (concept analysis)
- Use project rubrics/structure as guidance
- Ensure traceability by linking to domain/requirements
- Start with A3 integration (problem background, countermeasures)
- Create issues for tasks like "Draft Domain Rough Sketch" or "Set Up AsciiDoc Templates"

#### 🔬 Team: Research
**Responsibilities:**
- Handle domain and requirements acquisition
- Conduct interviews and literature reviews
- Research student inventory challenges (per A3)
- Evaluate Research APIs for shelf life/expiration dates
- Research item scanning tools (barcodes)
- Explore domain-related tools (e.g., for household notifications)
- Document findings in AsciiDoc
- Create issues like "Research Expiration APIs" or "Interview Potential Users for Domain Needs"

#### 🎨 Team: Design
**Responsibilities:**
- Create UX sketches and app design (wireframes, user flows)
- Focus on features from A3 (inventory by room/category, notifications, filters)
- Use tools like Figma or sketches in docs
- Include personas and validation scenarios
- Design notification flow and inventory dashboard UI
- Create issues like "Sketch Inventory Dashboard UI" or "Design Notification Flow"

#### 🔴 Team: Tech Stack
**Responsibilities:**
- Decide on tech decisions for front-end (e.g., React for UI/scanning)
- Choose back-end technologies (e.g., Node.js for APIs)
- Select database solutions (e.g., MongoDB for items/categories)
- Plan notifications system (e.g., Firebase)
- Align with A3 features (automated reminders, reports)
- Research API integration from Research Team
- Document in AsciiDoc (machine requirements)
- Create issues like "Evaluate Front-End Frameworks" or "Prototype Database Schema"
