## 🎯 Project Overview

**Topic:** Digital Home Inventory  
**Target Audience:** Students living independently (alone or with roommates)  
**Date Started:** February 3, 2026

### The Problem
Students living on their own struggle to keep track of household items, resulting in:
- **Wasted money** - Buying duplicates or unnecessary items
- **Expired items** - Food and medicine expiring unnoticed
- **Poor budgeting** - Difficulty staying within budget due to overstocking
- **Communication issues** - With roommates, leading to duplicate purchases

### Root Causes
- Students rely on memory alone
- No centralized system to track household spending
- Busy schedules (classes, work, personal life) leave little time for inventory management

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

For students living alone, it is very important to keep track of household essentials, but with the stressful lifestyle some students experience, it can be difficult to do so. The lack of keeping track of household items can lead to unwanted problems such as:
- Suddenly running out of essential items
- Food and medicine expiring without notice
- Purchasing duplicates
- Poor coordination with roommates

Most students are on a budget, and without a system to keep track of their items, it is harder to stay within budget due to overstocking.

## 🚀 Project Goals

### Target
Design a user-friendly digital system that helps students living independently to efficiently track, manage, and organize their household items.

### Key Features (Countermeasures)
1. **Digital Inventory Management**

   - Expiration date alerts
   - Customizable notification thresholds

3. **Efficient Organization**
   - Filter by category, location, or priority
   - Quick search functionality
   - Reduce time looking for items

4. **Budget Tracking**
   - Track spending on household items
   - Generate spending reports
   - Help manage budgets and avoid unnecessary purchases

5. **Roommate Coordination**
   - Shared inventory view
   - Prevent duplicate purchases
   - Clear ownership indicators

6. **Analytics & Reports**
   - Inventory reports
   - Expenditure analysis
   - Usage rate tracking
   - Shopping trip planning assistance

### Success Criteria (Check/Evaluate)
- ✅ Items display correctly in designated categories/rooms
- ✅ Updates and deletions are accurately reflected
- ✅ Notifications trigger at correct thresholds
- ✅ Filters return accurate results quickly
- ✅ Spending calculations match actual expenses
- ✅ Shared inventory syncs correctly between users

## 👥 Team Structure

### Agile Feature-Based Organization
The project follows **Agile development principles** with feature-based teams. Each team works independently on a specific feature, allowing parallel development without dependencies.

#### Team Formation
Teams are organized around key features identified during sprint planning. Each feature team is responsible for:
- **Full feature ownership** - From research to implementation
- **Independent development** - Work in parallel without blocking other teams
- **End-to-end delivery** - Research, design, implementation, testing, and documentation

#### Current Teams

**📚 Documentation Team (2 Team Leads)**
- **Team Lead:** Alondra S. Arce Perea (@alondra-arce)
- **Available:** 1 spot remaining

**Responsibilities:**
- Organize and compile all documentation from feature teams and Design Team
- Set up and maintain AsciiDoc structure and automation workflow
- Ensure documentation follows course rubrics
- Integrate contributions, review for quality, and prepare final Milestone documents
